# FingerTalker

**FingerTalker** is an AI-powered application that helps users **learn and recognize sign language letters** through hand detection.  
The project has two implementations:  

---

1. **Python version** → Directly uses the camera for real-time hand sign recognition.  
   - Works smoothly and delivers strong performance.  
2. **MERN version** → A web-based interface to make the project more interactive and user-friendly.  
   - Functional, but currently slower and requires optimization.
